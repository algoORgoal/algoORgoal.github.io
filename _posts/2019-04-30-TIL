String formatting in python:
{0} {1} {2} {3} . format(sequence)

Using python format string with lists
print(string.format(

Unpacking and packing:

function(object): doesn’t consider object as several arguments.
function(*object): 

Question: what does packing and unpacking do?

Packing: opposite for unpacking?
Question: why do I need to put unpacked variable into .format() function?

Long floating numbers made by division is automatically shortened when printing out in python3
ex) when a = 1.6888888898989898
print(“{0}”.format(a)) : print out 1.7

Doubling can print out {{ }} brackets.
